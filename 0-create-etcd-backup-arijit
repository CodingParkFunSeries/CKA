Here are the steps to take backup of etcd cluster. My guess is etcd backup is same as taking snapshot of the db into local machine. Backing up Data_dir folder will take back up of the whole folder. Itâ€™s really what is the question given.
In terms of SQL database, taking backup of the database will be sqldump to a sql file and restoring it if needed.
Here are the steps to take database backup with correct version on the local machine from the given endpoint

1. curl -L https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v3.3.1/etcd-v3.3.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o etcd-v3.3.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
2. tar xzvf etcd-v3.3.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
3. cd etcd-v3.3.1-linux-amd64
4. ETCDCTL_API=3 ./etcdctl --endpoints http://127.0.0.1:2379 snapshot save snapshotdb
5. ETCDCTL_API=3 ./etcdctl --write-out=table snapshot status snapshotdb # verify the snapshot
6. ETCDCTL_API=3 ./etcdctl snapshot restore snapshotdb # restore the backup

Please refer DR doc for etcd https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/recovery.md#restoring-a-cluster
